# Calorie Calculator

This project provides a **React-based calorie calculator** that goes beyond the typical “plug-in-your-weight” approach.  
It allows you to visualize weekly weight changes, set custom goals, and see how fixed daily intake affects your progress.

## Key Features

- **Mifflin–St Jeor Formula**  
  Calculates Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), then multiplies by an activity factor to estimate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).

- **Goal Weight & Fixed Intake**  
  Enter your target weight, specify a daily calorie intake, and see a week-by-week weight projection.

- **Interactive Chart**  
  Uses **Recharts** to display your projected weight loss/gain over time.

- **Weekly Rate Table**  
  Shows how many calories to eat if you want to lose or gain:
  - 0.25 kg/week  
  - 0.5 kg/week  
  - 1 kg/week
